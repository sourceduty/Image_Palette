[Image Palette](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-ifho2QQB0-image-palette) is designed to assist users in extracting colors from images and generating color palettes based on the extracted hues. When a user uploads an image, "Image Colour Palette" analyzes the visual data to identify prominent colors within the image. It then provides the user with a list of these colors in hexadecimal format (e.g., #FF5733). This functionality is particularly useful for designers, artists, and anyone working on projects that require consistent or inspiring color schemes derived from visuals.

Additionally, "Image Colour Palette" can use the extracted colors to create a new visual representation, such as a neatly arranged color palette image. This gives users a tangible and visually appealing way to see the color combinations at a glance. Beyond offering technical details like hex codes, the GPT delivers practical tools for creative projects and helps users streamline their workflows by turning images into a ready-to-use resource for design and art applications.
